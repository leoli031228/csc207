**Problem Domain**

Our team is creating an anime and manga categorising platform where users 
can browse new titles, track their progress, and connect with other fans.
* Users can search titles and find information about animes/mangas
* Users can track 
* Users can get personalized recommendations based on their watch history and favourites
* Users can search for items they want.
* Users can add to cart and make payments.
* Makes use of an API that provides data from MyAnimeList 


**Application Description**

Our team  is thinking of developing an application where users are able to create
an account (with their username, password, email, and phone number), then login to the app. 
From there, they can go to their profile to view their saved titles, their favourites, their watch history, and progress. 

On the homepage, users are able to browse featured titles and are able to filter titles by their genre or release date. 
There is also a search feature for the user to type a title they are looking for and the program will return a list of 
relevant titles. There can be an anime and manga class with attribute tags as a list containing the genres and tags of 
that title.

Users will also be able to add titles to their favourites and log the episodes that they have watched. They can also 
add titles that they are interested in watching to their watchlist. There can be a User class with attributes Watchlist, 
InProgress, and Favourites to keep track of these titles. Users are also able to rate titles and write reviews. 

User   personalized recommendations of titles they havenâ€™t seen before based on their watch history and favourites
